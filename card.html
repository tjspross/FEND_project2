			<p>Jigglypuff is a round, pink ball with pointed ears and large, blue eyes. It has rubbery, balloon-like skin and small, stubby arms and somewhat long feet. On top of its head is a curled tuft of fur. Jigglypuff's vocal cords can freely adjust the wavelength of its voice. This Pok√©mon uses this ability to sing at precisely the right wavelength to make its foes most drowsy.</p>
